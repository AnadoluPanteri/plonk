== Version 1.0 (Monday 6th June) ==
* Make puck spin based on angle...?
 * Are we doing this, or should the puck just stay static? If it spins, the "logo" will be unreadable; I have sort of been enjoying it as a static element. -TS

== Next Version ==
* Need a v2.0 code name?
 * Return of the Killer Paddle (?) - TS

* Add some sort of intelligent rotation to the menus:
 * Finger "pushable"?
 * Faces last winner?
 * Uses gravity?
 * Just make viewable in Landscape?

* Add more sounds. Paddle explosion. Bouncing of the walls. More?
 * Do I need to get some sounds for these elements? Or, are there enough from what was recorded in SF? -TS
  * If you could get those sounds, it would be great. I think we're already using all MeeGoConf sounds. -CH

* Go back to the larger logo for the About screen.
 * Remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun
 * Implement "Level" modes (art already pushed).

* Add support for keyboard input ("Netbook Edition")
