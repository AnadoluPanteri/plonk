* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed
  until a user presses the button 
 * IMO not that important -CH
 * I agree with Conny. -TS

* Reset gear needs to retract a little further into the panel so that it can't be seen.

* Add 'Exit' button
 * Art pushed (and explained via email). -TS

* Reset ball speed after a player scored

* Scoreboard should fly in from the side (left or right doesn't matter), with gears turning. Then, pause it a second (gears stopped) for the particle animation. Then, fly it off to the other side with gears turning again.

* In hopes that it won't get lost in the noise... I think we should go back to
  the larger logo for the About screen. I was expecting the screen to "grow"
  for the About screen and after seeing it thought that the larger logo worked
  great.  (+ remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space)

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun

* Add power zone to the center of the paddle. If ball hits power zone, gauge increases.
 * Is this a "power" zone or, is the paddle going to grow when the gauge gets to the top? We need to decide on this.
 * If it is a "power" zone, then when the gauge gets to the top, the gears can start turning, indicating that the player has more "power."

* Countdown: The "3" appears to be a few pixels higher than the other numbers. Maybe my eyes are playing tricks, though.

* Implement "Level" modes (art already pushed).
