  - Remove "zoom" effect of the logo from main menu -> about transition


== Bugs ==
* If the screen is touched by one player, the menu does not work.
 * I've tried to fix this by using TouchAreas instead of MouseAreas, however it's not that simple. If we want this to work, we basically need to cover the whole screen by a TouchArea while the menu is visible. The reason: If someone touches an area of the screen that is not covered by a TouchArea, this touch will block all other touches. -CH

* If the games is started via the launch icon and then exited, it is still visible in the task-switcher even if the process is not running anymore.

== Next Version ==

* Make puck spin based on angle.

* Add some sort of intelligent rotation to the menus:
 * Finger "pushable"?
 * Faces last winner?
 * Uses gravity?
 * Just make viewable in Landscape?

* Add more sounds:
 * Paddle explosion
 * Bouncing of the walls
 * Gauge ticking sound
 * Paddle lengthening sound
 * Paddle shrinking sound
 * Background music?

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun
 * Implement "Level" modes (art already pushed).

* Implement "Pause" screen (art already pushed).

* Add support for keyboard input ("Netbook Edition")
