== Bugs ==
* If the screen is touched by one player, the menu does not work.
 * I've tried to fix this by using TouchAreas instead of MouseAreas, however it's not that simple. If we want this to work, we basically need to cover the whole screen by a TouchArea while the menu is visible. The reason: If someone touches an area of the screen that is not covered by a TouchArea, this touch will block all other touches. -CH

* If the games is started via the launch icon and then exited, it is still visible in the task-switcher even if the process is not running anymore.
