* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed
until a user presses the button 
 * IMO not that important -CH

* Reset gear needs to retract a little further into the panel so that it can't be seen.

* Add 'Exit' button

* In hopes that it won't get lost in the noise... I think we should go back to
  the larger logo for the About screen. I was expecting the screen to "grow"
  for the About screen and after seeing it thought that the larger logo worked
  great.  (+ remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space)

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun

* Add power zone to the center of the paddle. If ball hits power zone, gauge increases.
