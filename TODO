== Version 1.0 (Monday 6th June) ==
* Fix the menu to make it nice looking again.
 * Power button needs to be there as well.
  * Make power button actually quit the app (it currently just sends it to the background)
* Everything from 'Next Version' if possible :)

== Next Version ==
* Add more sounds. Paddle explosion. Bouncing of the walls. More?

* Reset gear needs to retract a little further into the panel so that it can't be seen.

* Go back to the larger logo for the About screen.
 * Remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun
 * Implement "Level" modes (art already pushed).

* Add power zone to the center of the paddle. If ball hits power zone, gauge increases.
 * When the gauge gets to the top, the paddle grows (and gears turn). Paddle stays long for several seconds, as the gauge decreases back to 0, when the paddle shrinks (and the gears move).

* Countdown: The "3" appears to be a few pixels higher than the other numbers. Maybe my eyes are playing tricks, though.
 * That a problem with the artwork. I'm just showing the images as they are. -CH
 * Weird. I check the art and the numbers align just fine. I'll check again. -TS

* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed
  until a user presses the button 
 * IMO not that important -CH
 * I agree with Conny. -TS
