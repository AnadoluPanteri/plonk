== Bugs ==
* If the screen is touched by one player, the menu does not work.
 * I've tried to fix this by using TouchAreas instead of MouseAreas, however it's not that simple. If we want this to work, we basically need to cover the whole screen by a TouchArea while the menu is visible. The reason: If someone touches an area of the screen that is not covered by a TouchArea, this touch will block all other touches. -CH

* If the games is started via the launch icon and then exited, it is still visible in the task-switcher even if the process is not running anymore.

== Version 1.0 (Monday 6th June) ==
* Make puck spin based on angle...?
 * Are we doing this, or should the puck just stay static? If it spins, the "logo" will be unreadable; I have sort of been enjoying it as a static element. -TS

== Next Version ==
* Need a v2.0 code name?
 * Return of the Killer Paddle (?) - TS

* Add some sort of intelligent rotation to the menus:
 * Finger "pushable"?
 * Faces last winner?
 * Uses gravity?
 * Just make viewable in Landscape?

* Add more sounds. Paddle explosion. Bouncing of the walls. More?
 * Do I need to get some sounds for these elements? Or, are there enough from what was recorded in SF? -TS
  * If you could get those sounds, it would be great. I think we're already using all MeeGoConf sounds. -CH

* Go back to the larger logo for the About screen.
 * Remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun
 * Implement "Level" modes (art already pushed).

* Add support for keyboard input ("Netbook Edition")
