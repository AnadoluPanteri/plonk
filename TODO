* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed

* In hopes that it won't get lost in the noise... I think we should go back to
  the larger logo for the About screen. I was expecting the screen to "grow"

  great.  (+ remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space)

* Collision detection of ball seems to happen on the left side of the ball. Make sure that always the outer border (left and right) is used for collision detection

* Gears on paddle should only rotate if paddle is expanding/shrinking.
