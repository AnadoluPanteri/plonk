* Make the countdown start and appear *after* the 3-paddle-scoreboard or replace the countdown with something else (e.g. Player taps to launch ball)
  * Pushed custom numbers and "GO!" graphics. -TS
  * Countdown now starts after the scoreboard fades out. -CH

* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed
until a user presses the button 


* Display the number of won matches on the main menu
  * Pushed overlays to go on a 'stretched' menu panel (see prototype in src/art/proto). -TS

* Implement score reset
  * Art pushed and initial animation is complete. -TS
  * Reset gear needs to retract ba little further into the panel so that it can't be seen.

* Add 'Exit' button

* Replace ball with puck
  * Art has been pushed. -TS

* In hopes that it won't get lost in the noise... I think we should go back to
  the larger logo for the About screen. I was expecting the screen to "grow"
  for the About screen and after seeing it thought that the larger logo worked
  great.  (+ remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space)

* Collision detection of ball seems to happen on the left side of the ball. Make sure that always the outer border (left and right) is used for collision detection
