* Make the countdown start and appear *after* the 3-paddle-scoreboard or replace the countdown with something else (e.g. Player taps to launch ball)

* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed
until a user presses the button 

* Display the number of won matches on the main menu

* Implement score reset

* Add 'Exit' button

* Replace ball with puck

* Could the puck (now a ball) be changed in the layering order so that it passes behind the paddles?

* In hopes that it won't get lost in the noise... I think we should go back to
  the larger logo for the About screen. I was expecting the screen to "grow"
  for the About screen and after seeing it thought that the larger logo worked
  great.  (+ remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space)
