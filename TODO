== Version 1.0 (Monday 6th June) ==
* Make power button actually quit the app (it currently just sends it to the background)
* Make puck spin based on angle…?
 * Are we doing this, or should the puck just stay static? If it spins, the "logo" will be unreadable; I have sort of been enjoying it as a static element. -TS
* Everything from 'Next Version' if possible :)

== Next Version ==
* Add more sounds. Paddle explosion. Bouncing of the walls. More?
 * Do I need to get some sounds for these elements? Or, are there enough from what was recorded in SF? -TS

* Reset gear needs to retract a little further into the panel so that it can't be seen.

* Go back to the larger logo for the About screen.
 * Remove the small logo from the qrc + qml dir to save some space

* Fine-tune ball speed to make it more fun
 * Implement "Level" modes (art already pushed).

* Add power zone to the center of the paddle. If ball hits power zone, gauge increases.
 * When the gauge gets to the top, the paddle grows (and gears turn). Paddle stays long for several seconds, as the gauge decreases back to 0, when the paddle shrinks (and the gears move).

* At the end of a game, "Blue wins" or "Red wins" should be displayed
  until a user presses the button 
 * IMO not that important -CH
 * I agree with Conny. -TS
